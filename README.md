First year programming exam project done by [machholdte](https://github.com/machholdte), [alha20ab](https://github.com/alha20ab), [AKHAN2126102519](https://github.com/AKHAN2126102519) and [banner4422](https://github.com/banner4422).

It's a simple dating web application. No chat functionalities or profile pictures, but besides that there's the expected functions of a dating app. There's space for improvement with the potential match algorithm, and how it's handled in the frontend. Bcrypt password hashing and JWT are implemented.

The frontend is made with [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), backend uses [Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview) and a database provided by [Azure SQL Database](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/sql-database-paas-overview).
